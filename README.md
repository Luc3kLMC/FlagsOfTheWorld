This is freeware quiz-like game 'Flags of the world' -  
My first project for Python learning purposes.

My first 'bigger project' was called Flagi Europy (Flags of Europe) coded in Amiga AMOS,
(can be found at https://luc3klmc.github.io/amiga.html).
Now I'm trying to go further and learn Python while improving and expanding the idea.
